abstract = {We assess the spatial spread of a fold within a narrow elastic strip theoretically and computationally in the small deflection regime. We consider a hierarchy of folding-response ansatz, suitable for stretch-free deformation. The role of Poisson’s coupling between the two curvatures, and that of surface twist, is brought out. Here we show that there exists a critical Poisson’s ratio separating the regime of monotonically decaying fold profiles from that of decaying oscillatory folds. A spatially separable solution results in length-wise localised folds, the length scale of which is in excellent agreement with that obtained from simulations. The persistence length shows significant sensitivity to the Poisson’s ratio of the material. We also establish a mathematical analogy of the folding problem, with one of elastic structures on foundations, the restoring force being proportional to local deflection as well as shear in the foundation.}

abstract = {The vibration of a homogeneous circular membrane backed by two taut strings is shown to yield several harmonic overtones for a wide range of physical and geometric parameters. Such a membrane is present at each end of the barrel of an idakkā, an Indian snare drum well known for its rich musicality. The audio recordings of the musical drum are analyzed and a case is made for the strong sense of pitch associated with the drum. A computationally inexpensive model of the string-membrane interaction is proposed assuming the strings to be without inertia. The interaction essentially entails wrapping/unwrapping of the string around a curve on the deforming membrane unlike the colliding strings in Western snare drums. The range of parameters for which harmonicity is achieved is examined and is found to be conforming with what is used in actual drum playing and construction.}

abstract = {The large range of deformations of ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs) has often been proposed as a key advantage of these soft active materials. Nevertheless, many applications in soft robotics still cannot be addressed by current IPMC technology, demanding an even wider deformation range. Here, we empirically demonstrate the feasibility of integrating electrostatic actuation to enhance IPMC deformations. Through the use of external contactless electrodes, an electrostatic pressure is generated on the IPMC, thereby magnifying the deformation elicited by the small voltage applied across its electrodes. A mathematical model is established to predict the onset of the pull-in instability, which defines when electrostatic actuation can be effectively utilized to enhance IPMC performance.}

Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, a new approach to the design of soft active materials, which embraces the complexity of multiphysics phenomena across electrostatics and electrochemistry. Through principled experiments and physically-based models we investigate the integration of electrostatic actuation in ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs).},
