abstract: The vibration of a homogeneous circular membrane backed by two taut strings
  is shown to yield several harmonic overtones for a wide range of physical and geometric
  parameters. Such a membrane is present at each end of the barrel of an idakkā, an
  Indian snare drum well known for its rich musicality. The audio recordings of the
  musical drum are analyzed and a case is made for the strong sense of pitch associated
  with the drum. A computationally inexpensive model of the string-membrane interaction
  is proposed assuming the strings to be without inertia. The interaction essentially
  entails wrapping/unwrapping of the string around a curve on the deforming membrane
  unlike the colliding strings in Western snare drums. The range of parameters for
  which harmonicity is achieved is examined and is found to be conforming with what
  is used in actual drum playing and construction.
