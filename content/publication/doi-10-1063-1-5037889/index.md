abstract: The large range of deformations of ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs)
  has often been proposed as a key advantage of these soft active materials. Nevertheless,
  many applications in soft robotics still cannot be addressed by current IPMC technology,
  demanding an even wider deformation range. Here, we empirically demonstrate the
  feasibility of integrating electrostatic actuation to enhance IPMC deformations.
  Through the use of external contactless electrodes, an electrostatic pressure is
  generated on the IPMC, thereby magnifying the deformation elicited by the small
  voltage applied across its electrodes. A mathematical model is established to predict
  the onset of the pull-in instability, which defines when electrostatic actuation
  can be effectively utilized to enhance IPMC performance.
