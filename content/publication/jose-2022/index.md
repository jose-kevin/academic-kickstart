abstract: Flexural elastic waves and sound in solids are of great interest in wide-ranging
  contexts such as ultrasound in plates, geophysics, ocean engineering, aerospace
  and automotive structures, and musical acoustics. Despite bending waves being the
  most important elastic waves for such surface structures, their propagation in the
  presence of the inevitable non-uniformity is poorly understood. Here we show the
  branching and focusing behaviour of highly dispersive flexural waves travelling
  in elastic plates of non-uniform thickness. The thickness profile has isotropically
  correlated spatial randomness. The correlation length is much larger than the wavelength.
  The location of wave focusing shows a scaling relationship with randomness, which
  is consistent with those previously reported in other random media. We show this
  analytically and numerically. This suggests a universality in the scaling between
  the location of wave focusing with randomness and the correlation length, regardless
  of the physics of the waves in question.
