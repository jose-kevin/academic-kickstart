abstract: We assess the spatial spread of a fold within a narrow elastic strip theoretically
  and computationally in the small deflection regime. We consider a hierarchy of folding-response
  ansatz, suitable for stretch-free deformation. The role of Poisson’s coupling between
  the two curvatures, and that of surface twist, is brought out. Here we show that
  there exists a critical Poisson’s ratio separating the regime of monotonically decaying
  fold profiles from that of decaying oscillatory folds. A spatially separable solution
  results in length-wise localised folds, the length scale of which is in excellent
  agreement with that obtained from simulations. The persistence length shows significant
  sensitivity to the Poisson’s ratio of the material. We also establish a mathematical
  analogy of the folding problem, with one of elastic structures on foundations, the
  restoring force being proportional to local deflection as well as shear in the foundation.
