abstract: Materials engineering has greatly contributed to improving the performance
  of soft active materials, but these improvements have seldom met the compelling
  needs of science and engineering applications. Here, we demonstrate, for the first
  time, a new approach to the design of soft active materials, which embraces the
  complexity of multiphysics phenomena across electrostatics and electrochemistry.
  Through principled experiments and physically-based models we investigate the integration
  of electrostatic actuation in ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs).
