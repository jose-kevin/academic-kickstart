summary:
abstract: "We characterise the persistence behaviour of a narrow elastic strip when it is folded at an edge. Smalldeflections and rotations are assumed. The spatial localisation of a fold is characterised using a hierarchy ofansatz that assumes stretch-free deformation. We seek spatially separable solutions in the spirit of evolution ofa lengthwise localised fold. The fold profile shows two qualitatively distinct regimes: one with monotonic spatialdecay and another that is characterised by oscillatory decay. There exists a critical value of Poisson's ratioseparating these two regimes of behaviour. We observe excellent agreement between results from computationsand those from simple analyses using energy minimisation. Theoretical results are consistent with simple physicalexperiments. The persistence length is found to be very sensitive to the Poisson's ratio. Energy terms associatedwith shear, i.e. the twist within the folded surface, have a significant influence on the rich persistencebehaviour. The folding problem turns out to be mathematically analogous to that of beams on elasticfoundations when the foundation provides restoring force proportional to the local deflection as well as shear inthe foundation"
