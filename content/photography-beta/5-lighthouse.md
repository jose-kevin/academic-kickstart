Had recently bought a new camera. Cycled out to the lighthouse to take some pictures. Didnt bring any food or water.
Forgot all about it when I saw the moon. Hunger and thrist kicked back in on the trip back. Half cycled and half walked,
completely exhausted, all the way back to McDonald's in Ringk√∏bing.
