Hi!

I am a first year PhD student in the [Computational Engineering and Design Group](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/research/groups/ced.page) at the University of Southampton. I am exploring the effects of structural periodicity on characteristics of mechanical waves.

I graduated from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kanpur in 2017 with a BTech-MTech (Dual Degree). My masters thesis was in the area of musical acousitics.
